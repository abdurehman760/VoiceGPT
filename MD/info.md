## Querying Pinecone Based on User Responses

### Server Configuration
```plaintext
PORT=3000  # The port the backend will listen on
```

### OpenAI API Configuration
```plaintext
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key  # OpenAI API key (for server-side authentication)
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-realtime-preview-2024-12-17  # Model ID to use for real-time AI interaction
```

### Pinecone Configuration
```plaintext
PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key
PINECONE_ENV=us-east-1
PINECONE_INDEX_NAME=company-knowledge-base
PINECONE_HOST=https://company-knowledge-base-g9cxmr7.svc.aped-4627-b74a.pinecone.io
```

### Objective
To query the Pinecone index based on user responses in real-time, leveraging the OpenAI Realtime API for both text and audio inputs.

### Steps

#### Step 1: Set Up the Environment for Pinecone Integration

##### 1.1: Install Dependencies
**Objective:** Install the required packages for interacting with Pinecone and generating embeddings with LangChain.

**Steps:**
- Install the Pinecone client (via HTTP requests) and LangChain:
  ```bash
  npm install axios langchain pinecone-client
  ```
- Install necessary packages for file parsing (e.g., pdf-parse for PDFs, textract for DOCX, and plain text files):
  ```bash
  npm install pdf-parse textract
  ```

##### 1.2: Configure Pinecone in .env File
**Objective:** Securely store your Pinecone credentials and configuration in the .env file.

**Steps:**
- Add the following environment variables:
  ```plaintext
  PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key
  PINECONE_ENV=your_pinecone_environment
  PINECONE_INDEX_NAME=company-knowledge-base
  PINECONE_HOST=https://company-knowledge-base-g9cxmr7.svc.aped-4627-b74a.pinecone.io
  ```
- Make sure the Pinecone index is configured correctly (using cosine metric and 1536 dimensions for OpenAI embeddings).

#### Step 2: Transcribe User Voice Input
- Use the existing speech recognition setup in `public/VoiceGPT/script.js` to transcribe user voice input into text.

#### Step 3: Convert Transcribed Text to Embeddings
- Use Langchain or OpenAI embedding models to convert the transcribed text into vector embeddings.
- Ensure the embeddings are generated using the `text-embedding-ada-002` model for consistency.

#### Step 4: Query Pinecone Index
- Use the generated embeddings to perform a similarity search in the Pinecone vector index.
- Retrieve the most relevant documents based on the similarity to the user query.

#### Step 5: Integrate with OpenAI Realtime API
- Pass the retrieved context from Pinecone to the OpenAI Realtime API.
- Generate context-aware responses using the retrieved documents.

### Implementation

#### Example Code

```typescript
// Transcribe user voice input (handled in public/VoiceGPT/script.js)
const userResponse = transcribedText; // Assume transcribedText is obtained from speech recognition

// Convert user response to embeddings
const queryEmbedding = await pc.inference.embed('text-embedding-ada-002', [userResponse], { inputType: 'query' });

// Query Pinecone index
const queryResponse = await index.namespace("example-namespace").query({
  topK: 3,
  vector: queryEmbedding[0].values,
  includeValues: false,
  includeMetadata: true
});

// Log the query response
console.log(queryResponse);

// Pass the retrieved context to OpenAI Realtime API
const context = queryResponse.matches.map(match => match.metadata);
const openAIResponse = await openAIService.fetchResponse(context);

// Handle the OpenAI response
console.log(openAIResponse);
```

### Handling Real-Time API Response

To ensure the OpenAI Realtime API waits for the context before responding to the user, you need to modify the flow to include the context retrieval step before generating the response.

#### Modified Flow

1. **Transcribe User Voice Input**: Transcribe the user's voice input using the existing speech recognition setup.
2. **Convert Transcribed Text to Embeddings**: Convert the transcribed text into vector embeddings.
3. **Query Pinecone Index**: Perform a similarity search in the Pinecone vector index using the embeddings.
4. **Retrieve Context**: Retrieve the most relevant documents based on the similarity to the user query.
5. **Generate Context-Aware Response**: Pass the retrieved context to the OpenAI Realtime API and generate a response.

### Summary
By following these steps, you can effectively query the Pinecone index based on user responses and generate context-aware responses using the OpenAI Realtime API. This integration allows for real-time conversations with both text and audio inputs, enhancing the user experience with accurate and relevant information.
