## Project Plan: AI-Powered Context-Aware Communication with Pinecone Integration

### 1. Knowledge Base Integration

#### Step 1: Setup Pinecone
- Create a Pinecone account and set up a new index.
- Configure the index to store vector embeddings.

#### Step 2: Document Embedding
- Use Langchain to convert company documents (policies, guidelines) into vector embeddings.
- Ensure each document is associated with metadata (title, ID, last updated).

#### Step 3: Storing Embeddings
- Store the generated embeddings in the Pinecone index.
- Implement a mechanism to upsert (update or insert) embeddings when documents are added or updated.

### 2. AI-powered Context-Aware Communication

#### Step 1: Query Pinecone
- Implement a function to convert user queries into vector embeddings using Langchain or OpenAI embedding models.
- Use the generated embeddings to query the Pinecone index.
- Retrieve the most relevant documents based on similarity to the query.

#### Step 2: Generate Responses
- Pass the retrieved context to OpenAI's API.
- Generate context-aware responses using the retrieved documents.

### 3. Document Management

#### Step 1: Admin Interface (Train Page)
- Design and implement a web interface for admins to manage documents.
- Provide functionalities to upload, update, and delete documents.

#### Step 2: Document Upload
- When a document is uploaded, convert it into vector embeddings using Langchain.
- Upsert the embeddings into the Pinecone index.

#### Step 3: Document Update
- When a document is updated, delete the old version from Pinecone.
- Convert the new version into embeddings and upsert into Pinecone.

#### Step 4: Metadata Tracking
- Track metadata such as document title, ID, and last updated.
- Ensure metadata is updated appropriately during upload and update operations.

### 4. Security

#### Step 1: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Implement RBAC to restrict access to document management functionalities.
- Ensure only authorized users (admins) can upload, update, or delete documents.

#### Step 2: Authentication
- Implement authentication mechanisms to verify user identity.
- Ensure secure login and session management for admins.

### 5. Simple Train Page to Generate Embeddings in Pinecone

#### Objective
Create a page that allows users to upload documents, generate embeddings for the documents, and store those embeddings in Pinecone. This page will also provide an interface for managing the embeddings and updating them when necessary.

#### Task Breakdown

##### Step 1: Set Up the Environment for Pinecone Integration

###### 1.1: Install Dependencies
**Objective:** Install the required packages for interacting with Pinecone and generating embeddings with LangChain.

**Steps:**
- Install the Pinecone client (via HTTP requests) and LangChain:
  ```bash
  npm install axios langchain pinecone-client
  ```
- Install necessary packages for file parsing (e.g., pdf-parse for PDFs, textract for DOCX):
  ```bash
  npm install pdf-parse textract
  ```

###### 1.2: Configure Pinecone in .env File
**Objective:** Securely store your Pinecone credentials and configuration in the .env file.

**Steps:**
- Add the following environment variables:
  ```plaintext
  PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key
  PINECONE_ENV=your_pinecone_environment
  PINECONE_INDEX_NAME=company-knowledge-base
  PINECONE_HOST=https://company-knowledge-base-g9cxmr7.svc.aped-4627-b74a.pinecone.io
  ```
- Make sure the Pinecone index is configured correctly (using cosine metric and 1536 dimensions for OpenAI embeddings).

### 6. Use Pinecone Embeddings for Context-Aware Communication

#### Goal
Retrieve relevant context from Pinecone based on user input and pass it to the OpenAI API for generating more accurate, context-aware responses.

#### Requirements

##### Step 1: Query Pinecone
- Convert the user's transcribed text into embeddings using Langchain or OpenAI embedding models.
- Use the user message embeddings to perform a similarity search in the Pinecone vector index.

##### Step 2: Example Query
- Define your query:
  ```typescript
  const query = ['Tell me about the tech company known as Apple.'];
  ```
- Convert the query into a numerical vector using the `text-embedding-ada-002` model:
  ```typescript
  const queryEmbedding = await pc.inference.embed('text-embedding-ada-002', query, { inputType: 'query' });
  ```
- Search the index for the three most similar vectors:
  ```typescript
  const queryResponse = await index.namespace("example-namespace").query({
    topK: 3,
    vector: queryEmbedding[0].values,
    includeValues: false,
    includeMetadata: true
  });
  ```
- Log the query response:
  ```typescript
  console.log(queryResponse);
  ```
